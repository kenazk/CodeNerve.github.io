Hey there! My name is Kenaz Kwa. Testing this with Steven.

<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>You're probably wondering. It's pronounced KAY-NUSS.</p>
<p>I'm a Principal Product Manager at Puppet. Based out of Portland, Oregon.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p>I've built lots of products over the past 10 years in the enterprise infrastructure space. Products like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/author/kenazk/">Azure Virtual Machines</a> at large companies and products like Nebula at smaller companies. 

In particular, I've focused on understanding how to build product-led, enterprise B2B products for developer audiences.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
